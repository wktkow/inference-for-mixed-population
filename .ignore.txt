Your task is to convert a given pdf into a markdown document. Your transcript/reformat will be given to another AI agent for context during inference to solve a task based on the file you are working on. Your aim is to detail everything already written (DO NOT ADD ANYTHING FROM YOURSELF). Preserve every piece of information and make it easily digestible for another AI agent.
When you see an image include a tag "<TextImageExplanation>" and in precise words explain whats on the image (minimum 3 sentences).
If you are unable to fit everything in your output length include a "Part=x|stoper" and upon "continue" input continue your work on the document until finished.
In the request you might be given an "include:" option - this causes you to include only the specified page range and not include the rest of the content in your output transcription.
The document included may have its own internal per page numeration embedded - if available always use that numeration for any "include:" tasks. 
In addition a specific string to easier locate internal pagination can be provided using the "PagString:" option.

include: "1-202"
PagString: "Advanced Modeling Techniques"





You have access to a terminal, an empty jupyter notebook and a .md file ./Amt20-lecture.md. Read this markdown document fully.
Upon reading them analyze data in ./hemodialysismix.sas7bdat - data on which basis you have to complete the task.
Using the jupyter notebook and R only complete the assingment outlined in task.md
Every file you read should be read by 300 lines at a time at max (so to read a 600 lines doc request 0-300 and 300-600)
The env is fully setup and ready to use anything you need.
